# Data Portfolio
This is my humble portfolio containing projects, experiments, or the like that I
have carried out here and there. It contains two main categories, namely some of
the things I have done using the Julia language in 2019, and some of the things
I have done using SQL and R in 2022. 

I might add more and more over time. For example, I hope to learn Shiny and add
a small demonstration with it at some point.

(The content itself will be uploaded when I think it is time to do so.)

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this portfolio is for employers to see some of my works
having to do with statistics, data analysis, and the like. It is not at all a
complete demonstration of skills.

## The Julia Part (2019)
The Julia part uploaded here especially consists of visualizations and descriptive
statistics, after having done some tasks first, such as (1) understanding the
data, (2) cleaning the data (dealing with missing values, checking uniqueness,
etc.), (3) translating to the appropriate natural language, and so on.

Because I had some programming experience, though by no means extensive, and
because I since childhood always had an interest in computers, technology,
and so forth, I was comfortable using and learning Julia (or any other 
programming language) and the Julia REPL, which is what I preferred 
(sometimes in combination with Vim and text files) over using a combined
documentation and code environment (such as Jupyter). Even so, I was not and
am still not a good programmer. I was and am very practical about my use of
a programming language for statistics, data analysis, and the like.

The year 2019 was a time when I was feverishly learning statistics using
a manual calculator, some books, online resources, and so on, and a time
when I learnt many formulae by heart (to get more feel for mathematics and 
statistics), and a time when I for the first time used R before I quickly
jumped ship to Julia, because of its speed.

## The SQL and R Part (2022)
In 2020, because of other important matters, I generally stopped doing these
sorts of things with Julia more and more. Then, in 2022, I started to pick it
up again together with SQL, and soon, after having used Julia, Python,
Jupyter and some other tools, I found myself preferring SQL and R for various 
reasons.

SQL seems to be a standard that will probably always exist and be prevalent;
it is good for storing large databases; computer resource-wise, it seems to
be less taxing at least concerning RAM; it has good relational capability:
these are at least some of my reasons.

R, also a standard, is also very developed and my main use with it in this
context would mostly be further computation after SQL, such as statistical
computation and visualization. Even so, I still used R by itself too, if I
thought there was sufficiently good reason to do so. In addition, even though
R is generally slower than Julia and Python, it should not be a problem in
my case, for SQL would be used for the larger data if necessary, and R would
still be mainly used for further statistical computing and visualization.

### Learning SQL
For learning SQL, and again feverishly, I mostly used online resources, 
such as SQL practice webpages, a very informative video tutorial from
freecodecamp, information from a short online university course, and
personal practice. I also used pen and paper a lot, because it was good
to practice thinking out database designs with, and to theoretically
think out SQL code with it. There was also a small reference book, 
whose conciseness and quick clarity I preferred.

### Learning R
For learning R, I have mostly used online resources and books. Sometimes,
when necessary, I had to translate something I knew with Julia to R. When
I search for information, knowing more or less what I want, my searches
usually are very specific.

## Viewable Files
The 2019 Julia results, unfortunately having no documentation, are available
as SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics files).

The SQL and R results have been put into HTML documents made with RMarkdown.
